# JS_etch
JavaScript/Jquery project for theOdinProject


Done here,  

Things to improve:
- I could change the colors up to make it look a bit better
- Rearrange code so that if user inputs don't satisfy the conditions, it stops asking questions
	- Put inside of function instead of just a series of if/else statements?
